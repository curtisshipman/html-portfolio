<h1>The Best Movies According to Curtis</h1>
<h2>My top movies of all-time, by category.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Princess Bride</h3>
<p>This is my favorite feel good movie. It's like comfort food for my soul.</p>
<h3>Jacob's Ladder (Directors Cut if you can get it)</h3>
<p>
  This is my favorite thriller. It's intense, and a very dark, but not quite a
  horror movie.
</p>
<h3>The Transporter</h3>
<p>
  This is my favorite action movie. This is a great driving and fight
  choreography movie, and one of Jason Statham's early films that launched his
  career.
</p>
<h3>Hard Boiled</h3>
<p>
  This is my favorite shooter movie. This is the John Woo film starring Chow
  Yun-fat that changed how shooter movies in Hollywood are made. Directors are
  still following his action style today.
